    <h2 class="gallery-title"><b>Tony Tony Chopper</b> is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates in One Piece. He is a reindeer who ate the Hito Hito</br> no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a human-reindeer hybrid. Chopper is known </br>for his adorable appearance and often misunderstood behavior, as people tend to see him as a pet</br> rather than a capable doctor. Despite his cute demeanor, he is a skilled medical professional and a</br> fierce fighter, especially when using his various transformation forms. His dream is to become a doctor </br>who can cure any disease.</h2>
